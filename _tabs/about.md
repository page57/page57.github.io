Vrixton Phillips is a '20 graduate of Nicholls State University, Thibodaux, LA. He has a Bachelor's in English with a double concentration in Literature as well as Rhetoric & Writing.

Interested in poetry, tragedy, drama, philosophy, and language, he is currently preparing to enter graduate school in 2022 (hopefully in the field of Comparative Literature) to study Ancient Greek, French, and English tragic drama as well as Poststructuralism and Continental Philosophy, Deleuze and Guattari in particular.

More personally, Vrixton is an avid fan of classical music, having trained for many years for a career as a Classical Pianist. Although he turned his focus to Literature and Philosophy in light of becoming differently abled, he still enjoys playing the piano for his own private enjoyment, and still keeps tabs on the music world, even curating a music blog mostly composed of YouTube videos at Tumblr's [No Tritones for You](https://www.tumblr.com/blog/no-tritones-for-you)

His own love of music has affected his writing as well as his studies, preferring to write poetry in strictly metered verse rather than free verse, and his series of fictitious music and art reviews, still in production, and soon to be published on this blog, ***Imaginary Concerts in Real Spaces***, which stretches the limits of the possible in musical composition, dramaturgy, &c, yet grounding the imaginary in real places you can visit (or perhaps have been).
